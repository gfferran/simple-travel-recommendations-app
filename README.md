# "The Ocean"

# Motivation
- The idea for this project came to me during a recent roadtrip I took across central Japan with a friend. We wished to go from city A on the east coast to city B on the west coast, but we wanted to make sure to see some cool things on the way (waterfalls, hiking trails, towns, bars, etc). Looking up ideas on travel blogs and guides and then pinning them on a map seemed to be too much effort, so I thought it would be nice if we could just tell an app where we are, and get a bunch of nearby interesting places in return. Additional value comes from the fact that by allowing users to add their own favorite spots, a lot of beautiful places that travel websites overlook might be available on this app. Since the database is built collaboratively by the users, it includes both well-known and off-the-beaten-path places.
- In terms of learning, I wanted to dig a bit deeper into SQL and jinja using python.

# Description
Registered users can add new places, browse nearby places, and browse the most popular places in the country. Users can also rate (and delete rating or rate again) any place, and browse their own list of ratings.

# Tools
- Front-end: html, css, jinja, boostrap
- Back-end: python (including flask, GeoJS, and cs50), MySQL, JSON
